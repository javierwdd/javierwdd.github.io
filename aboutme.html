        <strong>Mexico and the Inland Empire</strong>
        <p>
          Born in the country of Mexico, my family and I came to the United
          States right around the time I was one year of age. Because of our
          very low income we moved around a lot, in search of a job, cheaper
          rent, or education. And so "home" for me doesn't really have a
          country, state, or even city attached to it. When asked where I'm
          from, I answer Mexico, and the Inlad Empire, the county where we
          generally lived within the confines of. Because of my Mexican
          citizenship, I am a DACA student, and the first from my highschool to
          attend Berkeley with such a title.

          <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong>
          <p>
            I curently am a fourth year at Berkeley, studying Mathematics. When
            I first started here, I came in with the intention to either major
            in Mathematics, or Computer Science. The former of which I had a
            passion for since I was a child. The latter I gained interest for
            after doing some career research during my highschool years. Because
            of this dual interst, I spent a lot of time taking classes which lie
            in the intersection of both. This looked like some CS classes,
            abstract Mathematics, Statistics, and on my own - learning about
            Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. This self discovery
            led to me being able to land a research position in the
            Undergraduate Research Program (URAP) here at Berkeley, and
            eventually being able to Intern at Autodesk because of that research
            position. Currently, I am focused on my graduation, and look forward
            to exploring my interests more in the industry.
